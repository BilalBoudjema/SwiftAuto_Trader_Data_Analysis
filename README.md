# Project Overview: Car Sales Analysis at SwiftAuto Traders

## Introduction

As a Data Analyst at SwiftAuto Traders, a renowned chain of car dealerships, I undertook a comprehensive analysis of car sales and profits across different dealers. The objective was to create insightful visualizations and dashboards, facilitating a deeper understanding of sales dynamics for each dealer. This document outlines the methodologies and tools I employed to achieve this.

### Project Components:
